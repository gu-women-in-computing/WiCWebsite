# WiCWebsite
Our club hopes to foster community for everyone interested in computer science and technology. 
We plan and take part in a large array of events every semester, from guest speakers and 
conferences to hackathons and movie nights. You don't need to know anything about coding to
be a part of our club, but we can't promise you won't learn after joining. 

# about this website
The goal of this website is for our club members to learn website basics, and therefore has
many aspects to improve upon. Future projects include adding more photos, updating the footer,
and creating an alumni page. Please feel free to contribute to and change this website. To do
so, you'll need to familiarize yourself with git and GitHub: [here is a link to an easy to follow
tutorial.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
