# WiCWebsite
Our club hopes to foster community for everyone interested in computer science and technology. 
We plan and take part in a large array of events every semester, from guest speakers and 
conferences to hackathons and movie nights. You don't need to know anything about coding to
be a part of our club, but we can't promise you won't learn after joining.
